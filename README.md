My Code Wars Challenges


How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript


Optimizations
I constantly refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readibility.


Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
